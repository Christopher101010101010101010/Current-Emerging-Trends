# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
## In this project, I was presented with code for an 2-dimensional 8 x 8 maze class, an experience tracking class, and base code for training an Artificial Intelligence agent. To complete this assignment, I was instructed to implement a training epoch loop along with the Q-learning algorithm.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
## The role of computer scientists is to apply a scinetific approach to developing technology to allow for innovation as well as advancing the disciplines that benefit from computer technologies. This pursuit is vital due to the magnitude of progress allowed to all industries by the intregation of automation, Artificial Inelligence, networking devices, and various other computertechnologies.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
## When investigating a new problem, first I seek to appreciate the key components of the problem, then I consider how the smaller characteristics of the problem can be solved, I'll reflect on past experience with similar problems, and perform the necessary research before beginning to design and implement a solution.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
## The ethical responsibilities when developing AI systems pertain to users' rights relating to confidentiality, equality, and respectful usage of data. Should the software be utilized by an organization, or corporation, similar practices shall be employed to ensure that operational data is not misused, the rights of the individuals within the organization are preserved; And likewise your employing firm should receive an equal level of respect as undue liability is avoid by maintaining ethical practices such as those outlined in the GDRP laws.
